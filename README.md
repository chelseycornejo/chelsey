### üí´ About Me:
I am a Front-End Developer based in üìçToronto.

Before changing careers, I worked as a Senior Buyer and understand the importance of paying attention to details in procurement processes. Similarly, in development, even the slightest errors can have significant consequences, so attention to detail is crucial. In my previous role, I analyzed data comparisons for new price books and vendor quotes. In development, we analyze website metrics to make informed decisions on design and functionality. I navigated complex processes in our company's software, troubleshooting issues that arose, which is also a valuable skill in development where debugging code and website troubleshooting are important tasks. Though my procurement experience may not seem directly related to coding, my skills have contributed to my success in development.
